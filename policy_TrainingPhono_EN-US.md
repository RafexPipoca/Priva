For some of our skills, it is necessary to save data for you, in our databases. That is in Amazon. This data is only connected to your Alexa-UserId, but never to your name or any other personal information. In the case of our "Phono Training" skill, we save only the nickname you choose, during the first use of using Skill. so that we can provide you with a personalized experience in using Skill.
